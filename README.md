# Audio Router

I created a similar app that does exactly what CheVolume does, except this is free at least for now. I tried to make a public post about it here on /r/software, but apparently they don't allow any download links to unknown apps in a text post.

If you want to test it out, [here's the download link (64-bit).](https://github.com/audiorouterdev/audio-router/releases/download/v0.10.2/AudioRouter-0.10.2.zip)

If you don't have a 64 bit OS, [here's the 32 bit version.](https://github.com/audiorouterdev/audio-router/releases/download/v0.10.2/AudioRouter-0.10.2-32bit.zip)

[Here's a simple gif to show how it's used.](http://i.imgur.com/uq6ApMe.gif)

For all feature requests/bugs/feedback, you can send me a  [PM.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=audiorouterdev) I highly appreciate all of them. The thread is now archived, so unfortunately you can't reply to it anymore.
